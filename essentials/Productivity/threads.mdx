description: "Threads help keep conversations organized by grouping replies to a specific message into a single discussion. Instead of cluttering the main chat, threads allow focused conversations that are easy to follow later."

### **What you’ll need**

1. Access to a workspace
2. Permission to send and reply to messages in channels or tasks

### **How threads work**

Threads are **automatically created** when users reply to a specific message in a conversation.

You cannot manually create a thread from the Threads page.

### **Create a thread**

1. Go to a channel or task where messages are posted.
2. Hover over a message you want to respond to.
3. Click **Reply** (or the thread/reply option).
4. Type your response and send it.\
   All replies to that message are grouped into a **thread**.

**View threads**

To view your threads:

1. Open the **Threads** section from the left sidebar.
2. You will see:
   - Active thread discussions
   - Threads where you have replied or been mentioned
   - If no threaded replies exist, the page will display **“No threads yet.”**

### **Where threads also appear**

Thread activity may also appear in:

- **Dashboard → Thread Replies**
- **@ Mentions**
- Related tasks or conversations

### \
**Notes**

- Threads are created only through replies to messages.
- The Threads page remains empty until at least one threaded conversation exists.
- This helps keep discussions structured and easy to revisit.
