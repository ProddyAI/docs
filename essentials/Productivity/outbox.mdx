## **Viewing messages in Outbox**

- Messages are grouped by **time periods** such as:

## **Filtering Outbox Messages**

Use the filters at the top to refine what you see:

- **All** – Shows all sent messages
- **Channels** – Shows messages sent to channels
- **Direct** – Shows messages sent via direct messages

This helps you quickly find messages based on where they were sent.

## **Export-related entries in Outbox**

When you export a note or document:

- An entry is automatically created in the Outbox
- The export metadata (format, file name) is logged
- Large exports may show encoded or raw content previews

This helps users confirm exports were triggered successfully.
