## **Purpose of the General Channel**

The General channel is commonly used for:

- Team-wide announcements
- Important updates and notices
- General discussions relevant to all members
- Sharing information that does not belong to a specific topic or project

All workspace members are automatically added to this channel.

## **Using General with Other Features**

The General channel supports all standard features, including:

- Chat messages and threads
- Boards for task management
- Notes for documentation
- Canvas for visual collaboration
- Calendar events from chat

This makes it a flexible and widely used channel.

## **Best Practices**

- Use the General channel for information relevant to the entire team.
- Avoid cluttering it with topic-specific discussions.
- Create separate channels for focused or project-specific conversations.
